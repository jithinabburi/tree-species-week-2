# Week 2 - Tree Species Classification

This repository contains a dataset of tree species images and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying different types of trees.

## Dataset

- The dataset (`dataset.zip`) contains images organized by tree species.
- Each folder inside the dataset corresponds to a specific tree species/class.

## Model

- A CNN model built using TensorFlow and Keras.
- The model is trained on the provided dataset to classify tree species.

## Usage

1. Download and unzip the `dataset.zip` file.
2. Preprocess the images and split into training and validation sets.
3. Train the CNN model using the provided training script.
4. Evaluate the model on validation data.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
